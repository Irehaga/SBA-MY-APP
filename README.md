# SBA-MY-APP

This app provides users with real-time weather updates based on their location. Users can enter their city, and the app leverages the OpenWeather API to fetch and display the current weather conditions for that location.

In addition to the weather feature, the app also offers a Bus Route feature. This is a straightforward feature where pre-defined bus route data for various cities is stored in an array. Using a loop, the app populates a dropdown menu with these cities. Once a user selects a city, the app promptly displays the available bus routes for that location.
